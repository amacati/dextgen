==========
The core module consists of two components. The first is the :ref:`optim.core.interior_point` function which minimizes a given function with equality and inequality constraints. The second component is the :ref:`optim.core.optimizer` which allows the addition of constraints, vector constraints, objective functions etc. to construct the optimization problem.
