=================
This module contains all environments that are implemented with the BarrettHand. The available environments are:

``FlatBarrettCube-v0``, ``FlatBarrettCylinder-v0``, ``FlatBarrettSphere-v0``, ``FlatBarrettMesh-v0``, ``FlatBarrettAll-v0``, ``UnevenBarrettCube-v0``, ``UnevenBarrettMesh-v0``.

Flat environments place the object on a flat surface. Uneven environments feature a work surface with uneven ground so that objects assume more diverse initial poses.
